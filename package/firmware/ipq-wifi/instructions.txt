## command to generate board file:
- ../../../../qca-swiss-army-knife/tools/scripts/ath10k/ath10k-bdencoder -c board-2.json
## How to get the input board files:
- extract OEM firmware
- get bootlog
- grep for "9888" or "4019" and figure out what board files is ath10k_pci trying to read.
- When you don't add a special board file the error message in the logs should tell you bmi_chip_id and bmi_board_id.
- For 4019 there needs to be a variant string in the board*.json but for 9888 there is no need.
-- How did I find this.. hit and trial.
